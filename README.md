|--------------------------|------------|----------
| username                 | credentials| username obtained from IBM Bluemix.
| password                 | credentials| password obtained from IBM Bluemix.
| audioFile                | File       | The audio file.
| audioType                | String     | The MIME type of the audio. See README for more details.
| model                    | String     | The identifier of the model to be used for the recognition request. Possible values: ar-AR_BroadbandModel; en-UK_BroadbandModel; en-UK_NarrowbandModel; en-US_BroadbandModel (the default); en-US_NarrowbandModel; es-ES_BroadbandModel; es-ES_NarrowbandModel; fr-FR_BroadbandModel; ja-JP_BroadbandModel; ja-JP_NarrowbandModel; pt-BR_BroadbandModel; pt-BR_NarrowbandModel' zh-CN_BroadbandModel; zh-CN_NarrowbandModel
| customizationId          | String     | The GUID of a custom language model that is to be used with the request. The base language model of the specified custom language model must match the model specified with the model parameter. By default, no custom model is used.
| continuous               | String     | Indicates whether multiple final results that represent consecutive phrases separated by long pauses are returned. If true, such phrases are returned; if false (the default), recognition ends after the first end-of-speech (EOS) incident is detected.
| inactivityTimeout        | String     | The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400 response code. The default is 30 seconds. Useful for stopping audio submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use -1 for infinity.
| keywords                 | String     | A list of keywords to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or more tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final hypothesis, not in interim results. Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords. Example: "colorado","tornado","tornadoes"
| keywordsThreshold        | String     | A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.
| maxAlternatives          | String     | The maximum number of alternative transcripts to be returned. By default, a single transcription is returned.
| wordAlternativesThreshold| String     | A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter.
| wordConfidence           | String     | Indicates whether a confidence measure in the range of 0 to 1 is returned for each word. The default is false.
| timestamps               | String     | Indicates whether time alignment is returned for each word. The default is false.
| profanityFilter          | String     | Indicates whether profanity filtering is performed on the transcript. If true (the default), the service filters profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. If false, the service returns results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only.
| smartFormatting          | String     | Indicates whether dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and Internet addresses are to be converted into more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition request. If true, smart formatting is performed; if false (the default), no formatting is performed. Applies to US English transcription only.
| speakerLabels            | String     | Indicates whether labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange are to be included in the response. If true, speaker labels are returned; if false (the default), they are not. Speaker labels can be returned only for the following language models: en-US_NarrowbandModel, es-ES_NarrowbandModel, ja-JP_NarrowbandModel. Setting speaker_labels to true forces the continuous and timestamps parameters to be true, as well, regardless of whether the user specifies false for the parameters.

## IBMWatsonSTT.registerCallback
Registers a callback URL with the service for use with subsequent asynchronous recognition requests. The service attempts to register, or white-list, the callback URL if it is not already registered by sending a GET request to the callback URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the challenge_string query parameter of the request.

| Field      | Type       | Description
|------------|------------|----------
| username   | credentials| username obtained from IBM Bluemix.
| password   | credentials| password obtained from IBM Bluemix.
| callbackUrl| String     | An HTTP or HTTPS URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. To be white-listed, the URL must successfully echo the challenge string during URL verification.
| userSecret | String     | A user-specified string that the service uses to generate the HMAC-SHA1 signature that it sends via the X-Callback-Signature header. The service includes the header during URL verification and with every notification sent to the callback URL. It calculates the signature over the payload of the notification. If you omit the parameter, the service does not send the header.

| events                   | String     | If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of notification events to which to subscribe. Valid events are: recognitions.started generates a callback notification when the service begins to process the job.; recognitions.completed generates a callback notification when the job is complete. You must use the GET recognitions/{id} method to retrieve the results before they time out or are deleted.; recognitions.completed_with_results generates a callback notification when the job is complete. The notification includes the results of the request.; recognitions.failed generates a callback notification if the service experiences an error while processing the job.
| userToken                | String     | If the job includes a callback URL, a user-specified string that the service is to include with each callback notification for the job. The token allows the user to maintain an internal mapping between jobs and notification events.
| resultsTtl               | String     | The number of minutes for which the results are to be available after the job has finished. If not delivered via a callback, the results must be retrieved within this time. Omit the parameter to use a time to live of one week. The parameter is valid with or without a callback URL.

| keywordsThreshold        | String     | A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.
| maxAlternatives          | String     | The maximum number of alternative transcripts to be returned. By default, a single transcription is returned.
| wordAlternativesThreshold| String     | A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter.
| wordConfidence           | String     | Indicates whether a confidence measure in the range of 0 to 1 is returned for each word. The default is false.
| timestamps               | String     | Indicates whether time alignment is returned for each word. The default is false.
| profanityFilter          | String     | Indicates whether profanity filtering is performed on the transcript. If true (the default), the service filters profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. If false, the service returns results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only.
| smartFormatting          | String     | Indicates whether dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and Internet addresses are to be converted into more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition request. If true, smart formatting is performed; if false (the default), no formatting is performed. Applies to US English transcription only.
| speakerLabels            | String     | Indicates whether labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange are to be included in the response. If true, speaker labels are returned; if false (the default), they are not. Speaker labels can be returned only for the following language models: en-US_NarrowbandModel, es-ES_NarrowbandModel, ja-JP_NarrowbandModel. Setting speaker_labels to true forces the continuous and timestamps parameters to be true, as well, regardless of whether the user specifies false for the parameters.
